	<p>{% trans "Between data sets and tasks, the relationship is one-to-many, as a data set can give rise to many different learning tasks. A method can also be applied to several different tasks, giving rise to solutions. On the other hand, a task can have many solutions, but each solution belongs to a certain learning task. These relationships are illustrated in the image below." %}</p>

	<p>{% trans "Given the described infrastructure, organising a challenge essentially boils down to selecting a group of datasets and appropriate data splits into training validation and test data, and choosing a machine learning task. As the data storage and evaluating mechanism is already taken care of by the basic data-repository one merely needs to add an administration interface and a challenge &quot;view&quot; on the data." %}</p>
