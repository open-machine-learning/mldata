<li><h3>ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</h3>
<p>Before using mldata.org, please carefully read this agreement. By using mldata.org, you agree to be bound by these terms and conditions. If you do not agree to these terms and conditions, please do not use mldata.org.</p>

<p>mldata.org reserves the right, at mldata.org's sole discretion, to change, modify, add or remove portions of these Terms periodically. Such modifications shall be effective immediately upon posting of the modified agreement to the website unless provided otherwise (e.g., when implementing major, substantive changes, mldata.org intends to provide users with up to fourteen days of advance notice). Your continued use of mldata.org following the posting of changes to these Terms will mean that you accept those changes.</p>

<p>Use of mldata.org constitutes full acceptance of and agreement to the Terms; if a user does not accept mldata.org's Terms, he or she is not granted rights to use mldata.org as defined herein, and should refrain from accessing mldata.org.</p>

<p>mldata.org reserves the right at any time and from time to time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any or all mldata.org (or any part thereof). mldata.org shall not be liable to any user or other third party for any such modification, suspension or discontinuance except as expressly provided herein.</p>
</li>


<li>
<h3>NO UNLAWFUL OR PROHIBITED USE</h3>
<p>By using mldata.org, you warrant to mldata.org that you will not use mldata.org, or any of the content obtained from mldata.org, for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms. If you violate any of these Terms, your permission to use the mldata.org automatically terminates.</p>
</li>


<li>
<h3>DESCRIPTION OF SERVICES</h3>
<p>mldata.org is owned and operated for the purpose of software development, discussion, implementation and innovation (the "Purpose"). We provide technology news, tools, products and education for the IT and developer community.</p>
</li>


<li>
<h3>REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</h3>
<p>When requested, each mldata.org Site user must: (1) personally provide true, accurate, current and complete information on the mldata.org Site's registration form (collectively, the "Registration Data") and (2) maintain and promptly update the Registration Data as necessary to keep it true, accurate, current and complete. If, after investigation, mldata.org has reasonable grounds to suspect that any user's information is untrue, inaccurate, not current or incomplete, mldata.org may suspend or terminate that user's account and prohibit any and all current or future use of the mldata.org (or any portion thereof) by that user other than as expressly provided herein.</p>

<p>Each user will receive passwords and account designations upon completing certain mldata.org Site registration processes and is wholly responsible for maintaining the confidentiality thereof and wholly liable for all activities occurring thereunder. mldata.org cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from a user's failure to comply with this Section 4, including any loss or damage arising from any user's failure to: (1) immediately notify mldata.org of any unauthorized use of his or her password or account or any other breach of security; and (2) ensure that he or she exits from his or her account at the end of each session.</p>

<p>All information, data, text, software, music, sound, photographs, graphics, video, messages, or any other materials whatsoever (collectively, "Content"), whether publicly posted or privately transmitted, is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated. This means that the user, and not mldata.org, is entirely responsible for all Content that he or she uploads, posts, emails or otherwise transmits via the mldata.org. No user shall transmit Content or otherwise conduct or participate in any activities on mldata.org that, in the judgment of mldata.org, is likely to be prohibited by law in any applicable jurisdiction, including laws governing the encryption of software, the export of technology, the transmission of obscenity, or the permissible uses of intellectual property.</p>

<p>mldata.org reserves the right to refuse or delete any Content of which it becomes aware and reasonably deems not to fulfill the Purpose. In addition, mldata.org shall have the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to refuse or delete any Content that it reasonably considers to violate the Terms or be otherwise illegal. mldata.org, in its sole and absolute discretion, may preserve Content and may also disclose Content if required to do so by law or judicial or governmental mandate or as reasonably determined useful by mldata.org to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of mldata.org' users and the public. mldata.org does not control the Content posted to the mldata.org and, as such, does not guarantee the accuracy, integrity or quality of such Content. Under no circumstances will mldata.org be liable in any way for any Content, including, but not limited to, liability for any errors or omissions in any Content or for any loss or damage of any kind incurred as a result of the use of any Content posted, emailed or otherwise transmitted via mldata.org.</p>

<p>Each user, by using mldata.org, may be exposed to Content that is offensive, indecent or objectionable. Each user must evaluate, and bear all risks associated with the use of any Content, including any reliance on the accuracy, completeness, or usefulness of such Content.</p>

<p>With respect to text or data entered into and stored by publicly-accessible site features such as forums, comments and bug trackers ("mldata.org Public Content"), the submitting user retains ownership of such mldata.org Public Content; with respect to publicly-available statistical content which is generated by the site to monitor and display content activity, such content is owned by mldata.org. In each such case, the submitting user grants mldata.org the royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive, transferable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, perform, and display such Content (in whole or part) worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology now known or later developed, all subject to the terms of any applicable license.</p>
