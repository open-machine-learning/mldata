		<dd>{% trans "This is a learning task, consisting of a formal description of input-output relationships based on a data set and methods for evaluating the results. This might also include fixed partitionings into training and test data for the base data set. For the MNIST example, a learning task might be to perform multiclass classification for all ten classes, using the F1-score as performance measure." %}</dd>

		<dd>{% trans "Essentially, a solution consists of a specific machine learning method applied to a learning task, but including all the other information, for example, what kind of feature processing has been applied, how parameters of the learning method have been selected, what operating system has been used, etc. Ideally, a solution also provides a single parameterless piece of code for others to re-run the experiments, preferably with source code." %}</dd>

	<p>{% trans "Between data sets and tasks, the relationship is one-to-many, as a data set can give rise to many different learning tasks. On the other hand, a task can have many solutions, but each solution belongs to a certain learning task. These relationships are illustrated in the image below." %}</p>

	<p>{% trans "Given the described infrastructure, organising a challenge essentially boils down to selecting a group of datasets and appropriate data splits into training validation and test data, and choosing a machine learning task. As the data storage and evaluating mechanism is already taken care of by the basic data-repository one merely needs to add an administration interface and a challenge &quot;view&quot; on the data." %}</p>
